      <div class="overlay-text">Congratulations on lasting one (business) week on the job! You hit some bumps along the way,
        but you took on the responsibility of making crucial decisions for the world. Understand that it is never truly one person
        making these decisions, nor does personal responsibility even trump collective power and responsibility. 

        <br><br>
        Changes are political, legislative, and global. Take action today, outside the game, to champion the cause of sustainability and 
        climate action to do your part in saving the world.</div>
