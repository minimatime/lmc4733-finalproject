        <br>You hit some bumps along the way, but you took on the responsibility of making crucial decisions for the world. Understand that it is never truly one person making these decisions, nor does personal responsibility ever trump collective power and responsibility.

         Changes are political, legislative, and global. Take action today, outside the game, to champion the cause of sustainability and climate action to do your part in saving the world. Climate change is made and experienced by people. How the future will play out is going to be shaped by choices taken by people today, and tomorrow, and the day after.
