      <div class="overlay-text">An email from a concerned civilian in South Asia arrives at your desk. It reads,

        ”Dear Editor,
        Last night, cracks appeared in our local mall that could be catastrophic. We have had issues with the owner for a while, as he keep constructing something new in the building every other day. Only last month, he added three floors to the building. I know your newspaper is very reputed, and I was wondering if you could cover this story. I believe they are also involved in manufacture.”
        
        Seems odd, and very concerning. Is this what the viewers want to read? There’s also an article on fashion trends that you have been putting off on editing and publishing.
        
        What do you do?</div>
