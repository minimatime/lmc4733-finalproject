            In 2030, despite attempts to decrease global carbon emissions, the numbers have not lowered and the effects of global warming have become more noticeable. According to a study by Heal the Planet, personal vehicles account for 60% of carbon emissions from the transportation sector. To force change, the government is considering forcing manufacturers to produce 80% electric vehicles starting next year. Another proposed solution is improving and incentivizing public transit through new infrastructure and environmentally friendly vehicles.</div>
