<div class="overlay-text"> Current conversations surrounding the climate and sustainability are very polarizing. Many of these conversations can leave people feeling helpless or feeling like what they do is not enough. The goal of the Butterfly Effect is to show that even small actions can ripple and have an effect even greater than imagined. The goal of the game is to leave people feeling empowered that their choices can have a positive impact on the world, even if they donâ€™t immediately see it.
