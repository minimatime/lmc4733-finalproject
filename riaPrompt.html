      <div class="overlay-text">It's Monday morning, and as the Editor in Chief of the nation's most influential news corporation, you arrive at your desk to find two controversial article pitches waiting for your approval. 

        The first article presents a groundbreaking study on the immediate benefits of renewable energy, suggesting it could drastically reduce carbon emissions within the next decade. 
        
        The second article is an investigative piece on the economic pitfalls of transitioning away from fossil fuels, highlighting potential job losses and economic downturns in regions dependent on the oil industry.
        
        Your choice will not only influence public opinion on climate change but could sway political policies and corporate investments in the near future. With the climate conference just around the corner and public sentiment on a knife-edge, the articles you choose to publish could tip the scales in favor of action against climate change or bolster the status quo.</div>
